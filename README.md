## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front-End Development student, currently heading into my second year of studies at Noroff. I'm eager to expand my skills and dive deeper into the world of web development, building user-friendly and accessible web experiences.

Originally from Norway, I hold a bachelor's degree in Occupational Therapy and have a solid foundation in working with people. Currently, I work as a supervisor at a company here in Norway, bringing strong leadership and problem-solving skills to the table.

At 28, I'm excited to combine my background and my growing knowledge in tech to make a meaningful impact. Looking forward to what's ahead in my coding journey!
